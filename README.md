## GBC 23 Ball Color Sorter - EV3 Classroom Edition

The provided software with the purchase of the [Mindstorms GBC 23 Ball Sorter](https://pv-productions.com/product/lego-gbc-23-ball-color-sorter-module-31313-or-45544-building-instructions/) instructions is an `.ev3` file that only runs in the [EV3 Lab](https://education.lego.com/en-us/downloads/retiredproducts/mindstorms-ev3-lab/software) code that is not compatible with current macOS versions. After some trial and error I have translated a similar in function version of the program that runs in the [EV3 Classroom App](https://education.lego.com/en-us/downloads/mindstorms-ev3/software).

You can buy the instructions, watch the video, and buy orange and white balls from [PV-Productions](https://pv-productions.com/product/lego-gbc-23-ball-color-sorter-module-31313-or-45544-building-instructions/).
